# Artificial-Intelligence
My project from my AI class I took in my senior year.

This project was done with a partner.

For the project we had to create/research a new type of algorithm based off of search algorithms we learned in class.  
My partner and I had decided to do a new version of A* search.  We decided to do a search based off of population density to find the best path to a destination.

All of the research and results we found are in the pdf file and our slides we had to present when we finished the project.

This project was done in Python and MATLAB.
